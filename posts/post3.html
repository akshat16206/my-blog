        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on June 25, 2025</em></p>
        <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>First, let's understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Any technique that enables computers to mimic human behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> The ability of a system to learn without being explicitly programmed.</li>
             <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A subfield of machine learning that extracts patterns from data using neural networks.</li>
        </ul>
         <img src="/assets/post3-demo1.png" alt="feature" width="720" height="400" />
        <p>In deep learning, we teach computers how to learn a task directly from raw data.</p>

        <h2>Why Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>Manually engineering features is time-consuming, brittle, and hard to scale. Deep learning answers the question: <em>Can we learn useful features directly from data?</em></p>
        <img src="/assets/post3-demo2.png" alt="feature" width="720" height="200" />
        <h2>Example: How Would You Detect a Face?</h2>
        <p>Imagine I tell you to build an AI that can detect faces in pictures. How would you even start?</p>
         <ul>
            <li>First, you'd look for simple things like lines and edges.</li>
            <li>Then, you'd detect curves ‚Äî like the roundness of an eye or cheek.</li>
            <li>Next, you'd combine those curves and lines to identify facial parts ‚Äî eyes, nose, ears.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'd assemble all those parts to recognize a full face.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>This is how humans intuitively recognize patterns ‚Äî from small pieces to the bigger picture.</p>
       <p>Now here‚Äôs the powerful part: deep learning does this automatically. You just feed the system enough images, and it learns these steps on its own ‚Äî layer by layer.</p>

       <h2>So What's the Big Idea?</h2>
       <p>The main idea of deep learning is this: You don‚Äôt need to hand-code every step. Just give the model enough examples, and it will figure out what patterns to look for ‚Äî from simple lines to full faces.</p>
       <p>That‚Äôs what makes deep learning so powerful.</p>

       <h2>Why Now?</h2>
       <p>Neural networks have existed for decades. So why is deep learning suddenly everywhere?</p>
       <p>Because three major things have changed:</p>
       <ol>
           <li><strong>Data:</strong> We now have massive amounts of data from phones, social media, sensors, etc. Deep learning thrives on data.</li>
           <li><strong>Compute Power:</strong> GPUs are now fast, cheap, and widely available, making it possible to train large models efficiently.</li>
           <li><strong>Open Source Tools:</strong> Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras make it easy to build deep learning models without starting from scratch.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>So while the ideas are old, today's tools, data, and hardware finally let them shine.</p>
